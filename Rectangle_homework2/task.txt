Create class Rectangle that stores only the Cartesian coordinates of the four corners of the rectangle.
The constructor calls a set function that accepts four sets of coordinates and verifies that each of 
 these is in the first quadrant with no single x - or y - coordinate larger than 20.0
The function also verifies that the supplied coordinates do, in fact, specify a rectangle.
Provide member functions that calculate the lenght, width, perimeter and area.
The lenght is the larger of two dimensions.
Include a predicate function square that determines whether the rectangle is a square.
